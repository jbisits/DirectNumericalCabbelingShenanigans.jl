# DirectNumericalShenanigans.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jbisits/DirectNumericalShenanigans.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jbisits/DirectNumericalShenanigans.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A Julia package (unregistered) to explore the cabbeling instability using Direct Numerical Simulation experiments built with [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl).

**NOTE:** Currently this repository is just experimenting some proof of concept setups, the full DNS setup is still to come.

To use the package:
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/jbisits/DirectNumericalCabbelingShenanigans.jl.git")
```
